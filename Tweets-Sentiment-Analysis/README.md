# Tweets Sentiment Analysis on U.S. Airlines
Using Python and Streamlit, we built an interactive web app that allows users to conduct sentiment analysis on major U.S. airlines. Twitter data was scraped from February 2015 and contributors were asked to classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets with supporting reasons.
